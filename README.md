# Charity blockchain app
## Overview
This is a simple blockchain app made in python.
The purpose of it is simply educational, but feel free to explore.

Idea behind it is to provide a transparent view of a charity organization, by placing all of it's funds and transactions made by
given organization on blockchain.

Because all of those transactions are made in the ecosystem we don't have a need to represent money with FIAT currency, so I've introduced new "cryptocurrency" named "Charity Tokens" (CT for short). 

## Project setup

run following commands:

```
source ./env/bin/activate
chmod +x ./setup.sh
. ./script.sh
./src/run
```

If all goes well, app should be available on: http://localhost:5000
